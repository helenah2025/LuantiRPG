## What is MMORPG?
MMORPG stands for "Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game", it is a video game design concept which combines aspects of role-playing with online multiplayer gaming. The core features of MMORPG's are:
* Persistent World: A shared online world that continues to exist and evolve even when players are offline.

## What is special about Luanti RPG?
